## 0.19.4 — Vercel deployment support

Existing football/F1 pages now have a minimal static build and serverless API adapter. [Deployment guide](docs/VERCEL.ko.md). Cloud deployment and live provider verification are separate from local tests.

# MatchLab — Football & F1

[한국어](README.ko.md) · [Repository](https://github.com/madferit94/matchlab)

## 0.19.3 — Standalone repository (2026-10-07)

Football and F1 now share this dedicated repository. The project-specific commit history, agents, skills, bilingual documentation, published datasets, model artifacts and version snapshots are retained. F1 remains version 0.7.2; this release changes repository packaging, not analysis behavior. Earlier notes below describe the state at each release date.

### Run locally

With a current Node.js runtime, run `node server/gemini.cjs` from this repository. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` for football or `http://127.0.0.1:8765/f1/index.html` for F1. English football: `/index.en.html`.

For the football AI analyst, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, configure your own provider credentials and supported model, then run `node --env-file=.env server/gemini.cjs`. API connectivity is not repaired or verified by this migration. F1's deterministic metric queries do not call an AI API. The local address is not a public deployment.

Original repository retained: [all-sports-analytics](https://github.com/madferit94/all-sports-analytics). Only the published MatchLab subtree is migrated; unrelated standalone F1/NFL experiments and private provider caches are excluded. [Migration specification](docs/SPEC-0.19.3.md).

## MatchLab 0.19.2 / F1 0.7.2 — Barcelona circuit image repair

Replaced the obsolete 404 image URL with the official 2026 circuit image. On failure, an aspect-preserving outline uses the recorded coordinates for the same session and circuit. Original data and models preserved.

## MatchLab 0.19.1 / F1 0.7.1 — Conditional metric queries

Query 30 metrics in Korean/English. Single-driver values use cards; multiple metrics have separate tables/charts. Selected-GP queries support lap ranges, pit-lap exclusions, numeric thresholds, top N and sort order, with visible applied conditions. Deterministic analysis without API calls.

## MatchLab 0.19.0 / F1 0.7.0 — Natural-language charts

Enter driver names and a metric for the selected GP to generate lap-time lines or comparison bars. Korean and English supported. A deterministic local parser calculates saved records without AI API calls. Unsupported events, dates and custom filters return guidance.

## 0.18.1 / F1 0.6.1 — Stationary pit-stop supplementation

13 DHL-derived GP files matched; 276 missing stop times filled. Partial averages show coverage. [Specification](docs/SPEC-0.18.1.md).

## 0.18.0 / F1 0.6.0 — Driver metrics and explanations

Driver metrics can be filtered by driver and category. Click metric labels for bilingual explanations and calculation scope. Responsive cards and help bubbles preserve readable labels and numbers. [Specification](docs/SPEC-0.18.0.md). Prior 0.17.2 preserved; user verification pending; this update has not been uploaded to GitHub.

## 0.17.2 / F1 0.5.2 — Slower circuit playback

Completed races now use recorded real-time playback at 1×, replacing the previous entire-race-in-60-seconds compression. Shared speed offers 0.25×, 0.5×, 1×, 2×, 4×, 10×, 30×, 60×. Upcoming forecasts use a labeled 180-second illustration. Earlier speed descriptions below are release history. Previous versions preserved; user verification pending.

## 0.17.1 · F1 shared playback speed

Prediction and recorded maps share one speed and cursor. Predicted circuit motion now uses the completed race lap count instead of three fixed loops. Driver progress and both languages are preserved. [Specification](docs/SPEC-0.17.1.md). Previous 0.17.0 preserved; user verification pending; no GitHub upload in this update.

# MatchLab0.17.0 · Driver progress during map playback

All-driver playback keeps the selected-driver inspector. The progress panel follows the cursor, with rank/lap/tyre/pit records and charts; later actual events are withheld. Paused single-driver view is retained. See [specification](docs/SPEC-0.17.0.md). Previous versions and models preserved; participant verification pending; no GitHub upload.

# MatchLab0.16.0 · Circuit map comparison

Existing Baku replay principles are ported to interactive circuit canvases: recorded coordinate traces, synchronized clocks and a strict two-second interpolation limit. Completed16GP maps compare22 predicted/recorded entries, with coordinates collected for two drivers per race and explicit lap reconstruction for others or gaps. Upcoming7GP maps use labelled2025reference traces and prediction only. Original models and football data remain unchanged. See [spec](docs/SPEC-0.16.0.md). User verification pending; not pushed to GitHub.

# MatchLab 0.15.0

Completed F1 GPs now compare retrospective pre-race predictions against recorded position changes and final classifications. The predicted board visualizes predicted final order; target race records are used only on the actual board. See [specification](docs/SPEC-0.15.0.md). Earlier versions are preserved; no GitHub upload in this task.

# MatchLab 0.14.0

F1 integration resumed after an interrupted build. Completed GPs open a recorded-lap pixel simulation, upcoming GPs open an experimental historical-result model. Coverage: 16 completed, 7 upcoming, 2 cancelled. Sports navigation connects Football and F1; original football records and predictions remain unchanged.

Replay is schematic, not GPS footage: location requests returned 404. The model uses ten pre-race indicators, 2025/2026 history and a final-six-GP time holdout. Win hit rate was 2/6; probability log loss 3.1195 was worse than uniform and recent-win baselines. Future entries are projected. See [release specification](docs/SPEC-0.14.0.md) and [F1 model](f1/release-0.2.0/modeling/README.md). User verification pending; this release has not been pushed to GitHub.

# MatchLab 0.13.0

Sport navigation connects Football and F1 on the same local server. GP names are separated from actual venue metadata. Bahrain meeting1308 is confirmed at Sepang, Malaysia; original OpenF1 records remain preserved.

# MatchLab 0.12.2

Site renamed to MatchLab in Korean and English. The AI planner retries one upstream HTTP 5xx failure, with a bounded 25-second timeout per attempt; authentication and quota failures are not retried. A live call reproduced provider_unavailable, while a fresh call with the configured key returned HTTP 200. Prior versions remain preserved. See [SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.12.2.md).

**Release 0.12.1 · 2026-10-07:** Logistic match predictions, learned goal-score distributions, continuous 22-player replay, readable metric cards, expanded fixtures and 57 selectable team charts. English agent/skill packages are now available alongside the Korean originals. [English agent and skill guide](docs/AGENTS-AND-SKILLS.en.md) · [Release SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.12.1.md). Input records remain a fixed 2026-09-20 snapshot; future prediction performance is unverified.

**0.12.0 · Metric visualization:** Select match trends or all47season metrics. Chart types follow data meaning: goals/Deep grouped bars, xG/PPDA lines, results/duels stacked counts, percentage bars on0–100. Missing seasons remain missing; chart tables expose values. Match filters and full-season scopes are explicit. Independent analyst/reviewer/director evidence in v31. [SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.12.0.md). Local update; not pushed.

**0.11.4 · Schedule navigation:** Show6more fixtures at a time on league and team schedules. Every team fixture opens its exact internal match preview, including comparison, model probabilities and simulation. Preview links survive refresh and language switches. [SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.11.4.md). Stored schedule; local update, not pushed.

**0.11.3 · Readable metric cards:** Cards adapt to each panel width. Metric names use readable16px text with word wrapping; numerical values stay on one line. Explanation buttons retain popovers with clear, borderless labels. Korean/English supported; pixel headings and numbers retained. [SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.11.3.md). Local update; not pushed.

**0.11.2 · Continuous replay:** Players advance, track the ball and carry it during dribbles. Ground passes, shots and post-goal returns share a continuous ball path; no goal-to-centre teleport. Removed the entire sample-score footer in Korean and English. Model probabilities and score distributions unchanged. [SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.11.2.md). Local update; not pushed.

**0.11.1 · Replay motion:**22 players,20 moving outfield players, player-linked dribbling/passing/shots, GOAL overlay and kickoff after scoring. Removed the internal model ID from the footer. Learned score distributions and outcome probabilities preserved. [SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.11.1.md). Not pushed.

**0.11.0 · Learned score distributions:** A Poisson goal model fitted to historical goals now supplies varied score samples, conditioned to preserve logistic win/draw/loss probabilities. Includes0:0 and high-scoring outcomes,4+ goal probability and top3scores. [SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.11.0.md). Fixed09-20record snapshot; future performance unverified; not pushed.

**0.10.0 · Logistic adoption:** The selected 111-input all-team model, trained on 1,518 matches, now supplies PL/LaLiga future probabilities and the pixel simulation. Input records through September 20; fixed snapshot, not live updates. Scores remain illustrative 1:0/1:1/0:1, not predicted goal counts. [SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.10.0.md). Not pushed to GitHub yet.

**0.9.2 · Local update:** Match links open internal analysis with final scores, xG, team metrics and strictly prior form. Removed calculation disclosure from analyst results. Training covers all teams; promotion correction is preprocessing. [SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.9.2.md). Not published to GitHub yet.

# MatchDesk — Football Analytics Agent Team

[English](README.md) | [한국어](README.ko.md)

**0.9.1 patch:** normalize CSS line endings when hashing publication files so Windows checkouts pass the same audit. The v23 interface, eleven-player replay and model are unchanged. [Patch SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.9.1.md).

**Release 0.9.1 · 2026-10-06.** A provider-neutral five-agent project for football evidence, team analysis, interactive viewing, independent review and traceable decisions.

0.6.0: Team names open club profiles; separate small links open exact Understat match pages in a new tab. Six detailed metrics now open explanation bubbles; the provider/count badge is removed.

0.7.0: Ask the analyst to calculate recorded goals/xG comparisons, league rankings and home/away summaries. Charts, tables, follow-up requests and calculation evidence run locally in JavaScript; AI model, SQL, Python and prediction tools are not connected. [Tool contract and owners](docs/ANALYSIS-TOOLS.md) · [Record skill](skills/record-analysis/SKILL.md) · [SQL workflow](skills/sql-analysis/SKILL.md) · [Python workflow](skills/python-analysis/SKILL.md). Run `node analysis/check.cjs` for 15 engine checks; viewer checks total 48 Korean + 23 English.

0.8.0: Gemini server adapter with ignored .env, strict tool validation and same-origin async mode. [Setup guide](server/README.ko.md). Run `node --env-file=.env server/gemini.cjs` then open http://127.0.0.1:8765. Set your key locally; no key is included in this repository. Server tests use mocked Gemini responses: live authentication/model verification is pending. `node server/check.cjs` adds 12 HTTP/server checks (98 total checks).

0.9.0: Experimental pre-match probabilities with attack/defence/pressing/recent-five features and cold-start smoothing; illustrated 8-bit replay now has **11 players per team (one goalkeeper + ten outfield players)**. Preserve v20 AI error messages, v21 result colours, v22 first replay and v23 player-count correction. [Model](modeling/prematch-v2-2026-10-06-v01/README.md) · [Feature fact check](docs/feature-factcheck-2026-10-06-v01/RESULTS.ko.md) · [Release SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.9.1.md). Predictions are **EXPERIMENTAL_NOT_ADOPTED**; replay is not real footage.

Research examples and improvement plan: [English](docs/prediction-research-2026-10-06-v01/README.en.md).

**Day13 workshop project.** [Local workspace location and move checks](docs/DAY13-WORKSPACE.md). Repository paths and viewer versions are unchanged.

## Open a viewer
- [English site](index.en.html) · [Korean site](index.html): full UI, 47 metric definitions and reading tips. Premier League 27 / LaLiga 29 clubs include historical teams. Header language links retain the selected team route; other filters reset when switching. Versioned Node VM checks are preserved; real browser rendering remains unverified.


- [Open MatchDesk — adopted 8-bit design](index.html) · [versioned v23](visualization-design-2026-10-06-v23/index.html).
- [Soft app design preview — v13](visualization-design-2026-10-06-v13/index.html).
- [8-bit pixel clubhouse preview — v14](visualization-design-2026-10-06-v14/index.html).
- [Three design directions](design-candidates-2026-10-06-v01/index.html).

Download/open HTML locally; GitHub's source view does not run it. This release does not host a website. Choose Matches, Teams or League. Team names/logos open the team overview; metric names open a meaning/reading-tip bubble. Search accepts the selected language’s labels, descriptions or original codes. The source/collection panel and external match links are removed from v11/v12 onwards.

## What works, and what is pending

The viewers show PL/LaLiga history, selected-match summaries, recent xG, fixtures, season history, team search and filters. The pixel/soft designs retain the same data and behavior. The user adopted the 8-bit design in 0.4.0. All 56 club logos now render from their original images onto 24×24 grids with crisp enlargement and an initials fallback. Real-browser rendering quality remains unverified.

The baseline prediction experiment is now archived in [modeling](modeling/README.md). Its new-season accuracy underperforms the comparison baseline; adoption remains **false**, and the first model is not adopted. The newer experimental v2 probabilities are displayed with an explicit non-adopted status. Automatic refresh, administrator authentication and hosting are not implemented. Claude runtime execution is unverified.

## Data scope

The HTML embeds **2,399 completed matches, 641 scheduled matches and 56 clubs**, plus 4,798 team-match detail records and 160 team-season snapshots with 47 StatMuse metrics. Completed totals: 760 in each of 2023/24–2025/26 and 119 in elapsed 2026/27. Last recorded completed date: **2026-09-20**. No refresh was performed for these design changes.

Understat is the core match/date/xG source; StatMuse supplies additional whole-season statistics. Date/venue/result filters apply to match data; StatMuse season totals are explicitly not filtered. Football-Data, odds and Champions League are excluded. No shot-coordinate dataset is available; player motion and goals in the replay are illustrative.

The published CSV package remains a **20-completed/2-scheduled demonstration subset**. Full training CSV and provider caches remain local; the larger HTML display data does not make the demo CSV a complete modeling corpus. Squad/value/news evidence has different observation dates and documented gaps.

## Five execution owners

| Agent | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Director | Plan, assign, track and decide after independent review |
| Research | Collect matches, auxiliary evidence and team news |
| Analyst | Team comparison and experimental modeling |
| Builder | Viewer, chart and service implementation |
| Reviewer | Independent calculation, data and model checks |

[Five-agent package](agent-team-integrated-2026-10-06-v01/README.md) · [Preserved ten-role package](agent-team-2026-10-06-v01/README.md) · [Actual archived run](team-run-2026-10-06-v01/README.md).
The actual representative Arsenal–Leeds/Malaga–Espanyol run used the previous ten-role arrangement; it is not relabelled as a five-agent run. Reviewer and final director stay separate from authors and each other. Model adoption and business decisions remain with the human user.

```

Python 3.11+ with the pinned NumPy requirement is needed for model tests; agent tests use the standard library. Node checks calculations/navigation/interactions with a DOM stub. **Real-browser rendering, mobile touch, remote logo/font loading and visual verification are pending; design adoption was explicitly confirmed.** A separate local source report is not an authenticated admin area. Historical snapshots still preserve earlier provenance. Team hex colours are UI choices, not verified official brand hex codes.

Archived run: 49 auxiliary entries (26 collected, 22 missing, 1 blocked), 117 squad players and 44 previous starters; an independent saved-input comparison recorded 271 checks. These verify scope and consistency, not every provider fact.

## Versions and specifications

[VERSION](VERSION) · [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) · [Release SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.9.1.md) · [0.3.0 SPEC](docs/SPEC-0.3.0.md) · [Version policy](docs/VERSIONING.md) · [Current viewer selection](viewer_selection.json) · [Content hashes](publication_manifest.json).
UI v01–v23 are preserved. Release 0.9.1 provides Korean index.html and English index.en.html identical to their v23 snapshots; earlier designs remain history. Older references and the original 0.2.1 manifest remain available. Some archived build/review commands describe the original local environment; use the checked-in HTML or current checks rather than assuming every old generator is portable.
